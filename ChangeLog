	command-line option.

2002-11-12 01:15  const_k

	* index.html: Applet height increased by 32 pixels.

2002-11-11 23:34  const_k

	* Makefile: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having just
	index.vnc should be enough.

2002-11-11 23:33  const_k

	* index.html, index.vnc: Extra .vnc files have been removed, having
	just index.vnc should be enough. Also, an example HTML page has
	been prepared, to simplify installation under a standalone Web
	server.

2002-11-11 23:13  const_k

	* README: Documented three ways to use the Java viewer, in the

2002-10-29 10:26  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java: Don't defer update requests if there is some data
	to receive, or if the last update included a PointerPos message.

2002-10-29 09:06  const_k

	* HTTPConnectSocket.java, HTTPConnectSocketFactory.java, Makefile:
	Support for connections via HTTP proxies using HTTP CONNECT method.
	 Most likely, this will not work in applet mode, due to security
	restrictions in JVMs.

2002-10-29 09:03  const_k

	* OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Added support
	for new CursorPos pseudo-encoding which allows to transmit pointer
	position from server to clients.

2002-09-24 14:29  const_k

	* RecordingFrame.java: A patch from Harmen van der Wal -- "a
	workaround for AFAIK a rare (Blackdown 1.1.7)
	SecurityManager.checkPropertyAccess() bug, that would otherwise be
	fatal for an unprivileged applet".

2002-09-24 14:23  const_k

	VncViewer.java: A patch from Harmen van der Wal, which makes it
	easy to plug-in alternative transport methods to the viewer. It can
	be useful for for things like HTTP tunneling, SSL support, or
	perhaps for integration with "zebedee", ssh or other tunneling
	mechanisms.

2002-09-23 18:52  const_k

	* VncCanvas.java: Reducing max frame size by 30 pixels in each
	direction, to leave some place on the screen, e.g. for the menu bar
	on Macintosh or the task bar on Windows; a patch from Steve Kann.

2002-08-27 05:23  const_k

	* README: Version string changed, version 1.2.6.

	version 1.2.5. Copyrights updated.

2002-07-05 01:37  const

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: More robust and
	correct methods to determine if Zlib- or Tight-encoded data should
	be saved Raw-encoded or re-compressed in recorded sessions. Also,
	always emit warnings in the Java console if such recoding was
	necessary.

2002-07-05 01:26  const

	* README: Minor documentation addition.

2002-07-04 23:17  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: JPEG quality setting should be enabled in the
	Options frame only in the 24-bit color mode.

	* RfbProto.java: Forgot to remove debugging output.

2002-07-03 12:38  const

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Re-compressing Tight-encoded
	rectangles when recorded session starts after the connection was
	established, to make it possible to decompress the data without
	knowing prior pixel data.

2002-07-03 07:11  const

	* VncViewer.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Special handling
	of Zlib-encoded rectangles -- they are written either Zlib-encoded
	if it's a beginning of RFB session, or Raw encoded otherwise. This
	is needed to make sure it will be possible to decode saved data
	without knowing the state of zlib compression stream used by the
	encoder.

2002-07-03 03:49  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java: The
	"Record" button now appears only if current SecurityManager allows
	access to the local filesystem.  Exceptions after an intentional
	disconnect are not shown in the applet panel or window any more.

2002-07-03 02:40  const

	* RecordingFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java,
	VncViewer.java: Implement dynamic toggling of session recording.

2002-07-02 23:34  const

	* VncViewer.java: Preparing to implement dynamic toggling of
	session recording.  The "Save Session" parameter was removed.

2002-06-30 22:44  const

	* RecordingFrame.java: Fixed copyright string.

2002-06-12 11:45  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java: A simple
	hack to make the RecordingFrame work, at least when the recording
	is being turned on before making the connection. The RecordingFrame
	is still not very useful but at least does allow to record a whole
	session in one file.

2002-06-12 05:03  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, Makefile, RecordingFrame.java, VncViewer.java:
	Added new "Record" button and a GUI to control recording of
	sessions in FBS files.

2002-06-04 11:01  const

	* Makefile, OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, SessionRecorder.java,
	VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Implemented experimental feature to
	save RFB sessions in FBS files compatible with rfbproxy, and the
	new "Save Session" parameter where a user can set a file name.
	Color format requested from the server was changed to little-endian
	to make saved sessions similar to ones written by the VNC
	Reflector, and to make colors compatible with RFB Session Player.

2002-06-03 22:55  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Cleanups in "throws" statements.

	* README: Documented new feature to refresh remote desktop in the
	view-only mode using "R"/"r" keys.

2002-04-23 06:02  const

	* ButtonPanel.java: Bugfix: keyboard focus could be set
	incorrectly. It was returned to desktop even when windows such as
	Options or Clipboard were created.  This looked like new windows
	had appeared behind the authenticator or desktop window, if the
	viewer itself was running in a separate window.

2002-04-09 12:10  const

	* VncViewer.java: Minor bugfix to prevent the "Refresh" button to
	disappear after the "Disconnect" button changes to "Hide desktop".

2002-04-09 12:05  const

	* VncViewer.java: Previous bugfix was broken.

2002-04-09 12:01  const

	* VncViewer.java: Minor bugfix to prevent dumping exceptions on
	pressing "R"/"r" keys over disconnected desktop.

2002-04-09 11:53  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Now "R"/"r" keys can be used to request screen
	updates in view-only mode.

2002-04-08 12:17  const

	* README: "Show offline desktop" parameter documented.

2002-04-08 12:12  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: "Show
	Controls" setting moved from OptionsFrame to VncViewer class.

2002-04-08 12:04  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, VncViewer.java: New "Show Offline Desktop"
	parameter allowing the disktop to be still displayed even after the
	remote side closed connection.

2002-04-02 09:12  const

	* AuthPanel.java: Disabling the password input field on activating
	connections.

2002-04-02 07:38  const

	disabled in the view-only mode.

2002-02-14 07:19  const

	* VncViewer.java: Removed calls printing debugging output.

2002-02-12 15:02  const

	* README, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Added new parameters
	"Defer screen updates", "Defer cursor updates", "Defer update
	requests", documented in README.

2002-02-12 13:03  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Made "Restricted colors" option dynamic.

2002-02-12 12:36  const

	* VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Code cleanups, preparing to make
	"Restricted colors" option dynamic.

2002-02-12 09:32  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, OptionsFrame.java, README, RfbProto.java,
	VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Documented applet parameters,
	updated copyright strings.

2002-02-12 05:53  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Solved all issues with JPEG image loading.  Added
	more comments in the source code.

2002-02-12 04:13  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Solved problems with
	asynchronous JPEG image loading, although the solution is not ideal
	yet. Now the ImageObserver interface is used only to track loading
	of JPEG images, and is not used with drawImage() method calls. 
	Draft scaling implementation appeared in previous CVS commit was
	temporarily removed in this revision.

2002-02-08 04:06  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Simple and inefficient scaling
	implementation, new "Scaling Factor" parameter.

2002-02-07 10:20  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, VncViewer.java: Preventing authentication
	retries when the PASSWORD parameter is used.  Closing windows and
	disconnecting on the applet shutdown.  Terminating the application
	properly on closing the authentication window.	Packing the window
	on reporting errors when in a separate window; this is necessary
	because it's possible that the window was empty.  Disconnecting on
	fatal errors.  Always forcing the keyboard focus go to the desktop
	on activating the connection.  Code re-organizations and cleanups
	e.g. new tryAuthenticate() method.

2002-01-30 10:25  const

	* VncCanvas.java: The frame size now should be limited by the
	screen size.  JPEG support improved, but drawing is still not
	reliable.  Minor code cleanups -- methods re-arranged.

2002-01-30 10:22  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: A small piece of debugging code removed.

2002-01-30 05:47  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Drawing model
	was changed again; now usual off-screen Image is used for
	double-buffering instead of MemoryImageSource.	Preliminary
	implementation of JPEG support in the Tight decoder.  New "JPEG
	image quality" parameter and corresponding item in the Options
	frame.

2002-01-24 22:49  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Bugfixes in the Tight decoder: recent changes
	broke 8-bit color mode.  Bugfixes in the XCursor encoding support:
	cursor colors were interpreted incorrectly.

2002-01-14 13:11  const

	* VncCanvas.java: 24-bit Tight decoder finished. Now it parses
	24-bit (not 32-bit!) color samples correctly, and is able to decode
	data pre-processed with the "Gradient" filter.

2002-01-14 10:46  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Preliminary working support for 24-bit colors in
	the Tight decoder.

2002-01-14 06:00  const

	* OptionsFrame.java: Color format was not set correctly.

2002-01-14 05:32  const

	* RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java: Code cleanups: changes in
	rfb.is.read() and rfb.is.readFully() calls.

2002-01-14 05:18  const

	* AuthPanel.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java: Support for
	24-bit color in RichCursor encoding.

2002-01-12 16:11  const

	* OptionsFrame.java, VncCanvas.java: Support for 24-bit colors. At
	this moment, all decoders support this color mode, with two
	exceptions of Tight and RichCursor.

2002-01-12 15:57  const

	* RfbProto.java: Removed a piece of code used for debugging.

2002-01-12 10:23  const

	desktop area, when the desktop is shown in a separate window.

2002-01-11 04:51  const

	* ClipboardFrame.java, OptionsFrame.java: "Dismiss" buttons renamed
	to "Close".

2002-01-10 14:19  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, VncViewer.java: Changes in the button panel.
	Now keyboard focus moves back to the authentication panel or to the
	desktop after pressing any button on the panel. Additionally,
	keyboard focus should move to the desktop automatically when VNC
	connection is established.

2002-01-10 13:53  const

	* ButtonPanel.java: Implemented new "Refresh" button. Pressing it
	results sending a non-incremental FramebufferUpdateRequest message
	to the server.

2002-01-10 13:51  const

	* VncCanvas.java: Now the viewer adjusts its desktop/window size on
	desktop size changes on the remote side (working support for
	NewFBSize pseudo-encoding).

2002-01-10 12:50  const

	* AuthPanel.java, ButtonPanel.java, ClipboardFrame.java, Makefile,
	OptionsFrame.java, RfbProto.java, VncCanvas.java, VncViewer.java,
	index.vnc: New "Open New Window" parameter was implemented, now the
	viewer can work in a separate frame instead of running in the
	applet area.  Class names were capitalized, to reflect usual Java
	naming standards.

2002-01-10 10:22  const

	* index.vnc: Inserted a <br> tag to prevent www.tightvnc.com link
	appear to the left of the applet area.

2001-12-17 11:39  const

	* ButtonPanel.java, Makefile: Converted to Java 1.1 event model.

2001-12-16 06:56  const

	* Makefile: First step of converting the source to Java 1.1: got
